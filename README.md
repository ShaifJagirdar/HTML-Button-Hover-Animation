# HTML Button Hover Animation

This is a simple project demonstrating a button hover animation using the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements in CSS.

## Features
- A centered button with a hover effect.
- Smooth transition effects.
- Styled with CSS for a sleek and modern look.

## Requirements
- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
- A local environment to run the HTML file (such as VS Code, Sublime Text, or any other code editor).

## Installation and Usage
1. **Download or Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ShaifJagirdar/HTML-Button-Hover-Animation
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Folder:**
   ```sh
   cd HTML-Button-Hover-Animation
   ```
3. **Open `index.html` in a Browser:**
   - Simply double-click the `index.html` file, or
   - Open a terminal and run:
     ```sh
     start index.html  # Windows
     open index.html   # macOS
     xdg-open index.html  # Linux
     ```

## File Structure
```
|-- project-folder/
    |-- index.html  # Main HTML file
    |-- style.css   # CSS styles for animations
```

## How It Works
- The button is styled with a border and text color.
- On hover, the `::after` pseudo-element expands to cover the button, creating a smooth transition effect.
- The text color changes dynamically to improve visibility.
